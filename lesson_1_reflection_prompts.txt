How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it was really enjoyfull task, that involved brain storming.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I would not have to save different version of all files manually.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    In automatic versiong control system we don't have to remembe to save manually, whereas in Git we can save every single version what we have changed.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because Git is coded version control system, but google docs is not.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will list out all commits produced, and git diff will compare two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Using version control i can fix my bugs easily.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    All versions of software files.
