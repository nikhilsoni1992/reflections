when would you want a remote repository rather making it on local computer.

I will need remote repository, when i will be working on project with multiple people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

By updating manually i can track more efficiently my files.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks is used to clone repsitory from one GitHub account to another GitHub account.
